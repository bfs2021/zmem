"""Host-gate evidence stdout_raw guard (issue #438 AC8, production seam).

The published host-gate evidence corpus under docs/host-gate-evidence/
must never retain raw recall memory in a capture's ``stdout_raw`` field.
The rule is NAME-INDEPENDENT for the payload rule: any ``*.json`` that
parses as a dict and carries a ``stdout_raw`` key must carry the fixed
REDACTED marker, whatever the capture is named. Launcher-capture names
additionally require a well-formed dict carrying the marker — a missing
key (e.g. ``{}``) or malformed JSON under a launcher-capture name is
unsafe. Malformed JSON under any other name is ignored (a
claude-run2-shaped file is JSON plus trailing text with no stdout_raw).

Issue #448 widens the guard with three additive surfaces, all stdlib-only
and parallel to ``unsafe_recall_paths`` (whose bytes/behavior are frozen
by tests/test_host_evidence_redaction.py):

- ``unsafe_incident_shape_paths(root, allowlist=None)``: flags any
  capture-shaped ``*.json`` dict (a ``remote_url`` key OR any string
  value containing ``://``) whose string values carry a credential
  key=value assignment matching the incident shape — the shape that
  leaked through refs/pull/402/head and that redaction.py's ``\\S{8,}``
  floor structurally missed. Values are NON-SPACE semantics: 4+ chars
  of ``[^\\s"']`` behind an optional single-or-double quote.
- ``unsafe_jsonl_transcript_paths(root, allowlist=None)``: scans
  ``*.jsonl`` transcripts line by line — a malformed line flags the
  file (fail-closed, .jsonl-only), and a fence open marker (live or
  neutralized) whose body carries no ``[REDACTED:`` notice flags the
  line. Memory-bearing text is walked from EVERY nested string carrier
  (payload.content[].text, payload.item.content[].text, state text
  carriers), never just top-level keys.
- the allowlist surface (``parse_allowlist`` / ``validate_allowlist``):
  a reviewed true-positive may be suppressed only by an entry pinning
  path + detector id + the file's CURRENT whole-file git blob sha +
  the zero-based hit ordinal + the total hit count — never a hash of
  the matched secret span (a span hash is structurally refused: the
  only hash field accepted is the whole-file blob identity).

Imported by tests/test_host_evidence_redaction.py (and the #448 check
files) as its enforcement seam (a test-imported module under scripts/
by design — there is no runtime caller; CI runs the importing test
files per the repo's direct-python loop); reports relative posix
filenames only, never evidence content.
