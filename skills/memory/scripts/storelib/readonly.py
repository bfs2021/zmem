"""WAL/journal-aware read-only store opens (issue #345).

``?mode=ro`` is not a no-side-effect open on a WAL store: SQLite creates the
``-wal``/``-shm`` sidecars (and mutates ``-shm`` read-marks) to service any
read, so a "read-only" surface can write to the operator's data directory.
This module is the THIRD read-only open in the repo — its copy-and-verify
policy is derived from the two prior implementations (decision_report.py,
rekey.py) but deliberately differs where noted (arm B opens the private
copy with a NORMAL connection so recovery completes, where
decision_report documents a read-only open as load-bearing; the guard is
``quick_check`` here vs decision_report's ``integrity_check``). The two
prior modules are NOT refactored onto this one (their callers pin
different consistency contracts); unifying them is tracked as design
follow-up, not silently claimed:

* Arm A — the store is quiesced (no ``-wal`` AND no ``-journal`` file):
  open ``?mode=ro&immutable=1``. Correct (nothing to recover or miss) and
  creates nothing. The journal check is load-bearing: with a hot rollback
  journal, ``immutable=1`` skips recovery and can read uncommitted pages
  already spilled into the main file.
* Arm B — any residue (``-wal`` and/or ``-journal``, including a zero-length
  ``-wal``): stage a PRIVATE copy of the store plus whichever residue files
  exist (never ``-shm`` — it is derived state, and copying it raised
  PermissionError under a live writer on Windows) in a throwaway temp dir
  OUTSIDE the operator's data dir, open the copy with a normal connection so
  hot-journal/WAL recovery completes on the private copy, then immediately
  pin it with ``PRAGMA query_only=1``. The operator's directory is never
  touched beyond the initial read of the bytes being copied.

Arm B reads a private SNAPSHOT: under a live writer the copy is not atomic
(decision_report's disclosed caveat), so the copy is guarded by
``PRAGMA quick_check`` and a torn copy refuses with :class:`ReadOnlyStoreError`
instead of serving garbage. When arm B is taken a one-line notice goes to
stderr; stdout contracts (e.g. classify-state's byte-pinned JSON) are never
touched.

Cleanup is explicit — there is deliberately NO weakref finalizer
(``weakref.finalize`` cannot reference ``sqlite3.Connection`` on this
runtime, and a finalizer that skips close-then-remove silently leaks a full
copy of the store). :meth:`ReadOnlyHandle.close` closes the connection FIRST,
then removes the staging dir, and reports a loud leftover warning when
anything survives (decision_report's ``_discard_stage`` contract).
